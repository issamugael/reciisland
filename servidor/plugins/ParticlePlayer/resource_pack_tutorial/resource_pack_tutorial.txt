To make a resource-pack that works with this plugin, follow these simple steps:

Preparing the audio file
1. Pick the sound of the video you want to play with the plugin
2. Make sure to have extensions on for files (you need to see the ".something" at the end of file names)
3. If the audio file does not end with a ".ogg" extension, convert it using https://convertio.co/
4. Rename your audio file "woodbreak.ogg"

Preparing the pack.mcmeta file
1. Copy the file called "sample.mcmeta" onto your desktop
2. Rename the file you just pasted to "pack.mcmeta"
3. Open the file
4. Replace "DESCRIPTION" with a brief description of your pack.
5. Replace "NUMBER" with the correct number following the table at https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pack_format
WARNING: If you don't know what number to replace "NUMBER" with, just put 9

Making the resource-pack
1. Make a folder and name it whatever you want (this will be the name of the resource pack)
2. Put your "pack.mcmeta" file inside that folder
3. Create a folder named "assets" inside the same folder
4. Create a folder named "minecraft" inside the "assets" folder
5. Create a folder named "sounds" inside the "minecraft" folder
6. Create a folder named "mob" inside the "sounds" folder
7. Create a folder named "zombie" inside the "mob" folder
8. Put your audio file from earlier inside the "zombie" folder

In the end you should have a file structure like this:
- Main folder (folder)
-|- pack.mcmeta (file)
-|- assets (folder)
-|-|- minecraft (folder)
-|-|-|- sounds (folder)
-|-|-|-|- mob (folder)
-|-|-|-|-|- zombie (folder)
-|-|-|-|-|-|- woodbreak.ogg (file)

IMPORTANT
To make the sound play along with the video, remember to add "audio" at the end of the /video command
